#  __My Dear Data Diary__
## What is a Dear Data Diary?
A Dear Data Diary is a concept derived from the Dear Data project conducted by Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec which began in Ocotober 2014 lasting a whole year. The project consisted of a complete week of collecting data and then inventing interesting ways of visualising that data. At the end of each week, they both sent eachother a postcard with the visualised data and the key to decode the data.

This project can be seen both online at [Dear Data, The Project](https://giorgialupi.com/dear-data) and in their book Dear Data, released 1 September 2016.

## Why am I doing this?
I enjoy proccessing, having a GUI instantly available makes coding so much more convenient and fun. This is part of a non compulsary module of the City. University of London Computer Science course.
